/* (Outer) Right - Join

This is essentiall a flip of the Left - Join.
All the records in the right-table are key, and data from the left join is brough over
where there is a match by unique key to the right table.  Any non-matches will result in 
missing values in the left-table columns. */

/* something to remember for both LEFT and RIGHT-Joins

the "right-table" will always come after the "JOIN" clause
the "left-table" will always come after the FROM statement */
